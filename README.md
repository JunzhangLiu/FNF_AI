# FNF_AI
Plays Firday Night Funkin' based on computer vision.<br/>
Purpose: I love rythm games but I'm bad at them, so just make an AI to play the game for me XD.<br/>
Some early results:<br/>
The program has made some progress only after a few epochs. Although it doesn't know how to deal with long keys, train a little longer might help.<br/>

Some times it does not press keys at the right time, this might be training data being influenced by the performance of my computer. I have an idea of how to fix this, have to do more experiments.<br/>
